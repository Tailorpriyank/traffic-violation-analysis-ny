# 🚦 Traffic Violation Analysis in New York State (2019–2022)

This project analyzes over **2 million traffic violation records** from the New York DMV (2019–2022) using **Tableau** to uncover trends in time, location, demographics, and violation types. Built as part of a capstone project at the **Katz School of Science and Health**, the goal was to deliver data-driven insights to the **New York Governor’s Traffic Safety Committee (GTSC)** for informed policy and enforcement decisions.

## 📌 Project Summary

- **Goal**: Identify patterns in traffic violations across age, gender, region, and time
- **Key Insight**: Speeding is the most common violation — especially among **young male drivers**
- **Time Trends**: Most violations occur midweek (especially **Wednesdays**), and peak in **March** and **May**
- **Location Trends**: NYC, Suffolk, and Nassau counties see the highest violation rates
- **Out-of-State Drivers**: ~21% of violations are committed by drivers from outside New York State

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Tableau** – Data visualization & dashboarding  
- **Excel / CSV** – Raw data input  
- **SQL (within Tableau)** – For data joins, filtering, and aggregation (queries not externally exported)
